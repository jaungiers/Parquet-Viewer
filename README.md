# Parquet Viewer

A fast, lightweight desktop viewer for `.parquet` files, built with Rust and [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).
Has a modern interface that opens extremely fast and can be bound to .parquet files to make it the default app for opening parquet files.

Windows binary available and compiled under `target/release/ParquetViewer.exe`.

## Features

- **Drag & drop** a `.parquet` or `.parq` file onto the window to open it
- **File dialog** via the `Open…` button or `Ctrl+O`
- **Virtual scrolling** — handles large files without loading the full table into view at once
- **Column sorting** — click any column header to sort ascending/descending (numeric-aware)
- **Search / filter** — `Ctrl+F` to filter rows by any matching cell value, with match highlighting
- **Schema display** — column names and data types shown in the header
- **Status bar** — shows row/column count and file size
- **CLI support** — pass a file path as an argument: `ParquetViewer.exe data.parquet`
- Dark theme
